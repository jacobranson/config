# The `bootstrap` command provided in this shell will
# create a temporary directory to store various files
# that should be copied over to the target system.
#
# The SSH Host Private Key of the target system is among them,
# because it is required to decrypt Agenix secrets,
# meaning that the only way to avoid a catch-22 of
# needing the SSH Host Private Key to decrypt the SSH Host
# Private Key is to get it onto the system out-of-tree.
#
# The SSH Host Public Key, while not stored in this repository,
# is derived from the SSH Host Private Key. The `bootstrap`
# command will also generate the correct SSH Host Public Key,
# and add it to the list of files copied over to the target
# system before rebooting into the new OS for the first time.

# TODO remove this workaround when the bug is fixed
